## Introduction ‚ÑπÔ∏è
Each component has a story page that describes all the "interesting" states in which a component supports.
A story page has one or more of the following sections:
- **Description:** Contains a short description of the component usage, an example of how to import it and examples of common usages and features.
- **API:** Detailed section with all the props names, types, default values, required values and descriptions.
- **Testkit:** Contains an import examples and API description of the component testkit.
- **Playground:** A graphical UI to interact with a component's arguments dynamically, without needing to code. It creates a code snippet which can be used in your application.

### Components and Testkit Usage üéâ
A component should be treated as a black box, so in order to help you test it within your code, we provide a set of utility functions called `testkit`.
For a detailed guide how to use a testkit refer to our [Testing guide](https://github.com/wix/wix-style-react/blob/master/docs/usage/testing.md)
Moreover, if you want to see specific examples, our tests are available and well documented under:
`src/ComponentName/test/<ComponentName>.spec.js`

### Frequently Asked Questions ‚ùì
You may find an answer to your question at the [Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/wix/wix-style-react/tree/master/docs/FAQ#frequently-asked-questions) article.

### Playground üèÄ
You can use the [Playground](https://www.wix-style-react.com/?path=/story/introduction-playground--playground) to easily test the component abilities. In order to share your code snippet with others, follow the following steps:
1. Edit the code snippet.
2. Click ![save-button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wix/wix-style-react/master/docs/assets/playgroundSaveButton.png) which located on the top right side of the code editor.
3. A generated url will be generated which can be shared with others. ![generated-link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wix/wix-style-react/master/docs/assets/generatedLink.png)

### Cheatsheet üëãüèª
The components inventory is displayed at the [Cheetsheet](https://www.wix-style-react.com/?path=/story/introduction-cheatsheet--components-cheatsheet) page which contains examples and links to the relevant documentation pages.

## Handling Issues üßê

### Debugging Strategies
When you run into an issue, don't panic, we have some recommendations how to solve it:
- Look for similar working examples in our documentation and try to find perhaps you missed something.
- Try to isolate the problem, comment out wrappers and other features gradually until you find the source of the problem.
- Verify that the latest version of wsr is installed (in node_modules, not package.json)
- Try to find whether there are external CSS that might override parts of our components.

If you **suspect** the issue you encountered is related to the component itself, before you report an issue try to verify by:
- Recreate the issue in our playground.
- Pin wsr to a prior version to see if there's no issue there.

Once you're absolutely sure the issue is ours, please let us know through the channel or by reporting an issue.

### Reporting an issue ![github-mark](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wix/wix-style-react/master/docs/assets/GitHub-Mark-32px.png)
We use GitHub issues as bugs and feature requests tracker.
If you think you have found a bug, or have a new feature idea- please start by making sure it hasn't already been [reported or fixed](https://github.com/wix/wix-style-react/issues).
You can search through existing issues and pull requests to see if someone has reported a similar issue to yours.

If it does not exist, please follow the following guidelines:
- Click [here](https://github.com/wix/wix-style-react/issues/new/choose) to choose the relevant issue template.
- Please begin the title with `<ComponentName/>` where appropriate, and use a succinct description that helps others find similar issues.
  - `<FilePicker/>`- `<some feature>` doesn't work ‚ùå [(Example)](https://github.com/wix/wix-style-react/issues/6202)
  - `<Table/>` - Add support for `<some feature>` ‚úÖ [(Example)](https://github.com/wix/wix-style-react/issues/5668)

- Please don't group multiple topics in one issue ‚Äì each issue should have its own github issue.
- Please add a link with a recreation of the issue within our [Playground](###playground).

#### Have you managed to resolve the issue?
- ‚úÖ A contribution to our [Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/wix/wix-style-react/tree/master/docs/FAQ#frequently-asked-questions) article is welcome! Check out our [contribution guide](https://github.com/wix/wix-style-react/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.
- ‚ùå Create [a GitHub issue](####reporting-an-issue).

### Wix Employees
Here are few more steps which can help with troubleshooting an issue we struggle with:
- Debug storybook on your local machine. You can place a `debugger` inside the story of your rebellious component.
- Search `#wix-style-react` slack channel for similar problems.
- Consult with your Guild Masters (Organization Wix Style React Expert / Heavy Users).
- Create a new yoshi project and try to recreate the issue in a clean environment. This can be helpful in order to check whether it's an issue with the component, driver or the project we currently work on.
- Check with your UX designer whether the desired spec was reviewed by Wix Style React UX team.
- Consult with `#wix-style-ux` slack channel for UX related questions.
